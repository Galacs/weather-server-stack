mqtt:
 # The MQTT broker to connect to
 server: tcp://mosquitto:1884
 # Optional: Username and Password for authenticating with the MQTT Server
 user: user
 password: password

 topic_path: "#"
 # Optional: Regular expression to extract the device ID from the topic path. The default regular expression, assumes
 # that the last "element" of the topic_path is the device id.
 # The regular expression must contain a named capture group with the name deviceid
 # For example the expression for tasamota based sensors is "tele/(?P<deviceid>.*)/.*"
 device_id_regex: "(.*/)?(?P<deviceid>.*)"
 # The MQTT QoS level
 qos: 0
cache:
 # Timeout. Each received metric will be presented for this time if no update is send via MQTT.
 # Set the timeout to -1 to disable the deletion of metrics from the cache. The exporter presents the ingest timestamp
 # to prometheus.
